        <p class="big_text">THE CREATION OF THE COSMOS</p>
        <p class="text">
            The Norse creation myth or cosmogony
            (an account of the origins of the cosmos)
            is perhaps one of the richest in all of world literature.
            First, let’s look at this exceptionally colorful story itself,
            then consider how the Vikings may have interpreted it and
            found meaning in it.

            The Origin of the Cosmos
        </span>
        <p class="text_right">
            Before there was soil, or sky, or any green thing,
            there was only the gaping abyss of <mark>Ginnungagap.</mark> This chaos
            of perfect silence and darkness lay between the homeland of
            elemental fire, Muspelheim, and the homeland of elemental ice,
            <mark>Niflheim.</mark>
            Frost from Niflheim and billowing flames from Muspelheim crept
            toward each other until they met in Ginnungagap. Amid the hissing
            and sputtering, the fire melted the ice, and the drops formed
            themselves into <mark>Ymir</mark>, the first of the godlike but
            destructive giants. Ymir was a hermaphrodite and could reproduce
            asexually; when he slept, more giants leapt forth from his legs
            and from the sweat of his armpits.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            As the frost continued to melt, a cow, Audhumla
            , emerged from it.
            She nourished Ymir with her milk, and she, in turn,
            was nourished by salt-licks in the ice. Her licks slowly
            uncovered Buri, the first of the <mark>Aesir</mark> tribe
            of gods. Buri had a son named Bor, who married Bestla
            , the daughter of the giant Bolthorn. The half-god, half-giant children of Bor and Bestla
            were <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Gods/index.html"><mark>Odin</mark> </a>, who became the chief of the Aesir gods, and his two
            brothers, Vili and Ve.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Odin and his brothers slew Ymir and set about constructing
            the world from his corpse. They fashioned the oceans from
            his blood, the soil from his skin and muscles, vegetation
            from his hair, clouds from his brains, and the sky from his skull.
            Four dwarves, corresponding to the four cardinal points,
            held Ymir’s skull aloft above the earth.

        <p class="big_text_ragnarok">RAGNAROK</p>

        <p class="text">
            Ragnarok is the cataclysmic destruction of the cosmos
            and everything in it – even the gods. When Norse mythology
            is considered as a chronological set of tales, the story
            of Ragnarok naturally comes at the very end. For the Vikings,
            the myth of Ragnarok was a prophecy of what was to come at
            some unspecified and unknown time in the future, but it had
            profound ramifications for how the Vikings understood the world
            in their own time. We’ll explore some of those ramifications below.

        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The word “Ragnarok” comes from Old Norse Ragnarök,
            “Fate of the Gods.” In an apparent play on words,
            some pieces of Old Norse literature also refer to it as Ragnarøkkr,
            “Twilight of the Gods.” The event was also occasionally referred
            to as aldar rök, “fate of mankind,” and a host of other names.
        </p>

        <p class="medium_text">The Fate of the Gods</p>
        <p class="text_right">Someday – whenever the Norns,
        those inscrutable spinners of fate, decree it – there shall
        come a <mark>Great Winter</mark> unlike any other the world has yet seen.
        The biting winds will blow snows from all directions, and the warmth
        of the sun will fail, plunging the earth into unprecedented cold.
        This winter shall last for the length of three normal winters,
        with no summers in between. <mark>Mankind</mark> will become so desperate
        for food and other necessities of life that all laws and morals
        will fall away, leaving only the bare struggle for survival.
        It will be an age of swords and axes; brother will slay brother,
        father will slay son, and son will slay father.</p>

        <div class="image_4"></div>

        <p class="text_final">The wolves <mark>Skoll and Hati</mark>, who have hunted
        the sun and the moon through the skies since the beginning of
        time, will at last catch their prey. The stars, too, will disappear,
        leaving nothing but a black void in the heavens. <mark>Yggdrasil</mark>,
        the great tree that holds the cosmos together, will tremble,
        and all the trees and even the mountains will fall to the ground.
        The chain that has been holding back the monstrous wolf Fenrir
        will snap, and the beast will run free. Jormungand, the mighty
        serpent who dwells at the bottom of the ocean and encircles the land,
        will rise from the depths, spilling the seas over all the earth
        as he makes landfall.</p>
