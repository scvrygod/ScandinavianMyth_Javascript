        <p class="gods_p">
            is one of the
            most complex and enigmatic characters in Norse mythology,
            and perhaps in all of world literature. He’s the ruler of
            the Aesir tribe of deities, yet he often ventures far from
            their kingdom, Asgard, on long, solitary wanderings throughout
            the cosmos on purely self-interested quests. He’s a relentless
            seeker after and giver of wisdom, but he has little regard for
            communal values such as justice, fairness, or respect for law
            and convention. He’s the divine patron of rulers, and also of
            outlaws. He’s a war-god, but also a poetry-god, and he has prominent
            “effeminate” qualities that would have brought unspeakable shame to
            any historical Viking warrior. He’s worshiped by those in search of
            prestige, honor, and nobility, yet he’s often cursed for being a
            fickle trickster. What kind of literary figure – let alone a god
            whose historical worship spanned much of a continent and several
            centuries – could possibly embody all of these qualities at once,
            with their apparently glaring contradictions.

        <p class="gods_p">
            is one of the most prominent figures in
            Norse mythology. He was a major god of all branches of the
            Germanic peoples before their conversion to Christianity,
            although he reached the height of his popularity among the
            Scandinavians of the late Viking Age.Thor, the brawny thunder god,
            is the archetype of a loyal and honorable warrior,
            the ideal toward which the average human warrior aspired.
            He’s the indefatigable defender of the Aesir gods and their
            fortress, Asgard, from the encroachments of the giants,
            who are usually (although far from invariably) the enemies
            of the gods.

        <p class="gods_p">
            is the wily trickster
            god of Norse mythology.
            While treated as a nominal member of the gods, Loki occupies
            a highly ambivalent and ultimately unique position among the
            gods, giants, and the other kinds of spiritual beings that
            populate the pre-Christian Norse religion.His familial relations
            attest to this. His father is the giant Farbauti.
            His mother is Laufey (the meaning of which is unknown)
            or Nal (Nál, “Needle”[2]). Laufey/Nal could be a goddess,
            a giantess, or something else entirely – the surviving
            sources are silent on this point.

        <p class="gods_p">
            sometimes Anglicized as “Frigga”
            is the highest-ranking of the Aesir goddesses.
            She’s the wife of Odin, the leader of the gods,
            and the mother of Baldur. Strangely for a goddess
            of her high position, the surviving primary sources
            on Norse mythology give only sparse and casual accounts
            of anything related to her personality, deeds, or other
            attributes. The specifics they do discuss, however, are not
            unique to Frigg, but are instead shared by both her and Freya,
            a goddess who belongs to both the Aesir and the Vanir tribes
            of deities.

    <div>
        <div class="image_baldur" onclick="playBaldur();"></div>
        <p class="gods_big" onclick="playBaldur();">Baldur</p>
        <p class="gods_p">
             is one of the Aesir gods. He’s the son of Odin and Frigg,
            the husband of the obscure goddess Nanna, and the father
            of the god Forseti.
            He’s loved by all the gods, goddesses,
            and beings of a more physical nature. So handsome,
            gracious, and cheerful is he that he actually gives off light.
            The meaning and etymology of his name are uncertain and
            have been the topic of intense scholarly debate. Numerous
            possibilities have been proposed, including a derivation
            from the Proto-Indo-European root *bhel- (“white”),
            Old Norse bál, “fire,” or a hypothesized word for “lord”
            common to various Germanic languages. The most straightforward
            – and probably correct – explanation, however, is that his
            name comes from the Old Norse word baldr, “bold.”
