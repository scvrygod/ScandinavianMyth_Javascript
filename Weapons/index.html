            <b>Considering</b> the warrior lifestyle of the Vikings,
            it is no surprise that weapons played an important role
            in Norse mythology. Almost all the Norse gods had special
            magical weapons that enhanced their warrior abilities.
        </p>

        <p align="center" class="text_1">
            Here are 5 of the most interesting and powerful norse mythological
            weapons wielded by the Norse Gods according to Norse mythology.
        </p>

        <p class="big_text">Gungnir</p>
        <div class="image_1"></div>

        <p class="text"><b>Gungnir</b>, which means ‘swaying one’
        in Old Norse, was the spear of <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Gods/index.html">
    <mark>Odin</mark></a>, god of war and knowledge
        and the king of the Asgardian gods. The spear is said to be
        so well balanced that it never misses its target, regardless
        of the skill of the wielder. Norse mythology prophesizes that
        this is the spear that Odin will use during the great battle
        of <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Events/index.html"><mark>Ragnarok</mark></a>, the end of the world.
</p>
        <p class="text_anim">Spears were actually the most common weapon
        used by Viking warriors, so it is little surprise that the main
        weapon of the Viking god of war was a spear. In Norse mythology,
        Odin is described throwing his spear over the heads of the Vanir
        gods, the other race of gods in Norse mythology, before a mighty
        battle between the Aesir and Vanir gods. The story does not specifically
        state whether this was Gungnir. The Vikings also used to throw their
        spears over the heads of their enemies at the start of battle as an
        invocation of Odin.</p>

        <p class="big_text">Gleipnir</p>
        <div class="image_2"></div>

        <p class="text">
            While an enchanted ribbon may seem like a strange
            artefact to appear in the myths of the ferocious Viking
            warriors, <b>Gleipnir</b>, which means ‘open one’ in old Norse,
            is actually one of the most important objects in Norse mythology.
        </p>

        <p class="text_anim">
            In order to prevent the mighty wolf Fenrir, a son of the god
            <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Gods/index.html"><mark>Loki</mark></a>,
            from wreaking havoc across the nine worlds of Norse mythology,
            the Asgardian gods decided to chain him up. They needed to trick
            the wolf into putting the chains on himself, so they told him
            that the chains were a game and a test of his strength.
            Knowing his own strength, Fenrir agreed to don huge chains
            twice, which he easily broke. The Asgardian gods then asked
            the dwarves to create a chain possible of containing Fenrir,
            and they created Gleipnir.
        </p>

        <p class="big_text">Mjolnir</p>
        <div class="image_3"></div>
        <p class="text"><b>Mjolnir</b>, which means ‘grinder’ or ‘crusher’
        in old Norse, is the hammer of <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Gods/index.html">
    <mark>
        Thor</mark></a>, the Norse god of thunder
        and fertility. It is considered one of the most fearsome weapons
        in Norse mythology, with the power to level mountains.
</p>
        <p class="text_anim">
            This is another mythological weapon that <a href="G:/webs/Dark/Gods/index.html">
    <mark>
        Loki</mark></a> obtained from the dwarves.
            Loki was forced to visit the dwarves when, in a particularly mischievous
            mood, he cut off the golden hair of Thor’s wife Sif.
        </p>

        <p class="big_text">Skofnung</p>
        <div class="image_4"></div>

        <p class="text"> <b>Skofnung</b> was the sword of the legendary Danish
        king Hrolf Kraki and was considered the best of all swords in the northern
        lands. </p>

        <p class="text_anim">It was believed to be supernaturally
        sharp and hard and imbued with the spirits of the king’s twelve
        faithful berserker bodyguards. According to the sagas, the sword
        cannot be drawn in the presence of women, and that the sun must
        never shine on the sword’s hilt. It is also said that a wound made
        by Skofnung will never heal, unless rubbed with the Skofnung stone. </p>

        <p class="big_text">Angurvadal</p>
        <div class="image_5"></div>

        <p class="text"><b>Angurvadal</b>, which means ‘stream of anguish’
        in old Norse, was another magical sword. According to Norse mythology,
        it was inscribed with Runic letters which blazed in times of war,
        but only gleamed with a dim light in times of peace. According to
        Norse mythology it belonged to Frithiof, son of the hero Thorstein
        Vikingsson.</p>

        <p class="text_anim">
            The sons of the king of the Norwegian region,
            King Beli of Sign, were jealous of Frithiof as he
            was said to be the tallest, strongest and bravest
            of men. In their jealousy they prevented Frithiof
            from marrying their foster sister Ingeborg. They sent
            Frithiof on a mission to Orkney, and while he was away
            burned down his homestead and married Ingeborg to the
            elderly King Ring. Left with nothing, Frithiof sails
            off with Viking warriors to earn his fortune.
